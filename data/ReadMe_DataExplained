FIREbox_Galaxy_HostVSate.csv

This dataframe was create to look at the separation between hosts and satellites
For each galaxy, there are parameters reported in physical units
For Satellite galaxies the distance to the host is reported along with other comparisons to the host
For host galaxies the distance to the nearest satellite along othe other comparisons to that satellite


#*******************************************
FIREbox_Group_satellite_distances.csv

This dataframe was created to look at the separation between satellites in a group
I look at each group, and I report the separation between each galaxy in that group
I also report the mass ratio and I flag the nearest neighbor for each galaxy


#*******************************************
FIREbox_distance_nearestneighbor.csv

This data frame was created to determine the closes neighbor to each galaxy
This was created by using FIREbox_Galaxy_HostVSate & FIREbox_Group_satellite_distances
For each galaxy I found the nearest neighbor and report values coresponding
